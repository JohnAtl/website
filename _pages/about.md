Throughout my career at my former employer, I went above and beyond (and even received an award for doing so) my assigned duties to identify and solve problems outside my assigned duties. This often involved teaching myself new skills to apply to the problems at hand. This was good preparation for being laid off in 2008. This, in turn, became my opportunity to chose my next path. I had wanted to use my electronics, engineering, and software development skills to help people with disabilities, and being laid off gave me that opportunity. I found a Master's program in prosthetics and orthotics that I was interested in, and started my bachelors. Along the way, I realized that doing research related to disabilities would allow me to potentially help a larger number of people than seeing them one-on-one in a clinic. I developed a Life Vision statement that included "creating a body of work to help people with disabilities." My focus became entering a PhD program. After being accepted and doing a couple of lab rotations, I settled on the Cognitive Motor Control Lab where I research how sensory and motor changes, applicable to amputation, stroke, and other contexts, affect the way people perform reach and grasp tasks. I'll finish my PhD by the end of summer, and the work I've done will fulfill that part of my Life Vision.

My research experience runs the gamut from building research equipment for human subjects research, to collecting EEG, fMRI, and motion capture data, analyzing those data, and preparing visualizations, and most importantly understanding their meaning. My previous background has been very useful in these endeavors, enabling me to build reseaarch equipment for our lab, and mentor and assist other grad students in developing their own research equipment. I have also developed equipment that has allowed our lab to collect richer datasets by co-registering data from disparate systems, such as EEG, motion capture, and eye tracking systems.

Nearing the end of my PhD, I am looking for an employer for which I can apply my broad range of research, scientific, and engineering skills to help them address their most interesting and challenging problems.
