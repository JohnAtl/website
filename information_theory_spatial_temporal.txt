I've been thinking about Information Theory lately, specifically, information communication. Claude Shannon pioneered the field in 1948 while working at Bell Labs. His work dealt with the ability to transmit information (messages) over noisy channels, and the probabilities of being able to recreate the original message. This communication is often considered in the realm of transmitting messages over various media to different locations, such as wires from one location to another, by radio waves such as for Wi-Fi, etc. All taking place in what could be called a spatial domain.
I recently realized (and I'm sure this is not original to me) that there is another medium through which we transmit information, and that is time. This can be as simple as writing a note on paper. We encode the information into text, and store it on paper. At some later time, we retrieve that information. This information is subject to degradation over time - ink fades, coffee is spilled, our original "encoding" is flawed due to our bad handwriting. Another scenario might be saving a file to a disk, which is then put on a shelf as a backup. Some years later, thanks to fading of magnetic fields or electrical charges (aka. bit rot), or chemical changes, the information is degraded. Thus, information transmission through time is subject to degradation just as is information transmission through space.
While there are testing methods for information transmission through spatial and temporal domains, the revelation for me was thinking about information transmission  not only through space, but also through time.
This all relates to another interest of mine, which is how we acquire knowledge. We seek out information related to some subject, distill it down into its essence, make novel connections between these concepts and the reader's pre-exitsting concepts, then write this pre-existing and new information back out in a form to be transmitted through time. This process is then repeated by the next reader - take in the information, distill it down into its essence, make connections with existing knowledge, etc. I wonder how this process can be improved? How can be use text and images to convey the information through time so that the knowledge graph (linked concepts) that resides in the author's mind can be recreated in the receiver's mind?
