Pcb-gcode enables creating printed circuit boards using a router or milling machine to outline the traces of the board, and to drill the holes. This eliminates the need to use toxic chemicals like ferric chloride, and also results in faster turn around than sending files to a board shop.

Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnatl/pcbgcode).
